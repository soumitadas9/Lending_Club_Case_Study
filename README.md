# Lending Club Case Study
Lending money to individuals with a high level of riskiness poses the most significant financial threat, commonly referred to as credit loss. Credit loss represents the financial shortfall experienced by the lender when a borrower fails to repay their debt or absconds with the owed funds.

The primary goal is to effectively pinpoint these high-risk loan applicants, ultimately reducing the volume of credit losses incurred. This case study aims to utilize Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify such applicants.

Our objective is to conduct an in-depth analysis to uncover the key factors or variables that strongly correlate with loan defaults. These variables serve as robust indicators of defaulting behavior. By gaining insights into these drivers, the company can apply this knowledge to enhance its portfolio management and risk assessment processes
